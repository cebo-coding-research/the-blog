                                As Mbabane’s population has slowly grown over the last few years, the housing market has appreciated in value where different areas and neighbourhoods such as the <i>Woodlands Township</i>, have experienced an observable spike in the number of houses being built.
                            <p>
                                As a relatively new resident myself, the majority of the housing development in the area has come from the <i>Woodlands Extension 2</i> section. As such, more people have begun to live in or around the area.
                            </p>

                                The consequence of this steady growth in population has become visible in our daily lives. The volume of business in the Shopping Centre continues to grow steadily and service delivery of valuable utilities and services such as internet and education, are walking in the right direction. At the time of writing even, a small playground is in the works at the base of the hill near the junction. 
                            </p>

                                Be that as it may, there are a few concerning aspects that remain attached with the developing suburb.

                                For one, crime, although stagnant this year, has risen in the last 4 years. Energy supply has and still is a nagging problem for households across the country, let alone the growing neighbourhood. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, the rise in population has not necessarily led to better business in the area. The Shoprite supermarket, for example, has not caught up to rising demands of the people and its national competition. <i>268 Jams</i>, a restaurant in the Shopping Centre, does not receive a constant flow of customers until certain times of the year, which inevitably limits its revenue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In my quite personal opinion, the young community of <i>Woodlands</i>, is rather neglected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I say this in the sense that, besides an educational centre (such as <i>Woodlands High School</i>) or leaving the area entirely, there are no opportunities available for recreation to young people living in the area. Monkey bars on the side of a hill or a mini-slide within a restaurant are hardly sufficient for many young people.

                                Of course, the creativity of the African Child has always been limitless – young people have and always will be easily able to come up with ways to entertain themselves. Whether its talking about TWWWOG, backyard soccer, treasure hunts or imposter games, small games can fill the empty space for many unoccupied children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite this however, the reality of the matter remains that these inventive games can only last for so long. As time has passed, Gen-Z has vividly demonstrated that when the options for fun dwindle, a ‘quick’ scroll on Instagram, or a game of EAFC on their PS4 console becomes the next best thing for many.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Indeed, being an adolescent myself, makes these details extremely easy to see. It’s the one thing every parent has complained about at one point or another in the past decade – our ‘addiction’ to our devices, whether with gaming or social media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To some extent, they have a point. According to <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2026-global-overview-report#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1760250903402_359509">datareportal</a>, social media user numbers have grown by an average of 7.18% YoY for the past 5 years, with young people (aged 16-24) leading in the number of hours spent on social media (2h 47 min avg.), across the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, one would assume that Eswatini is no outlier to the trend. Even though a vast number of children in the country today do not have access modern technologies, let alone a reliable internet connection, for the ones that do, the trend remains the same.
                            </p>

                                Children growing in the developing neighbourhoods have often become attached to the digital identities they have been encouraged to develop by their digitalised environments. As a result, when they grow from childhood into teenagers, they learn a variety of habits (sometimes harmful) related to social media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Spending time playing sports outdoors is one habit that one rarely sees amongst teens. Teens can spend time outdoors, but at times, it really seems as if they have got nothing better to do at home. Unless you constantly have money to spend, going out seems like an endeavour done out of boredom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <i>Woodlands</i> area lacks the spaces necessary to attract people to gather outside their houses, without having to open their wallets. There are no open fields, no courts or even open green spaces with benches. The only spaces available? Extremely squashed backyards and sloping, asphalt roads that are a part of the mountainous terrain. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It has become difficult for a child to play a sport in the neighbourhood. Virtually impossible for a group of people to do it together on safe, spacious terrain. Large street gatherings, such as a <i>braai</i> are rare, leading to the reality the youth finds themselves in today. Spending a majority of their time on their devices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a lack of moderation, this encourages a route of growth and development that often doesn’t favour the child’s future. From learning harmful sleeping habits to declining academic performance and mental health, there a few reasons why spending so much time on a device could be a problem for a developing child.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This has eventually led me to ask: how helpful would a recreational area be to the development of the young people in the growing <i>Woodlands Township</i>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Paying attention to a child’s development from birth to teen-hood is an essential component of building functioning members of society. It’s the reason why children are sent to school (even if it’s against their wills): to develop them holistically – their cognitive abilities, physical attributes, emotional intelligence and social conditioning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What regularly goes under the radar however, is the time children spend outside of schools. It often possesses the greatest influence on the development of the child, where the people that matter most to the child, are most present.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That is for the most part, the home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As impactful as the home is, the absence of a ‘third space’ in between the home and school leaves a gap in valuable experiences for the child. Playing outdoors with friends in the neighbourhood isn’t an academic activity that challenges their already exhausted minds. Nor is it a place where the child is directly influenced by the voice of an adult.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More importantly, it’s hard to keep a phone stuck to your face, when the sunlight outside makes it difficult to see your favourite apps.

                        <div id="paragraph-4" class="paragraph-container">
                            <p>
                                That is where a recreational area is supposed to come in. Communities with infrastructure that encourages young people to engage in different leisurely activities thrive with brighter minds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For example, a small field could grow the next generation of football or volleyball players. A court could introduce more children to basketball and tennis. A communal hall opens up a variety of events for young people to participate in, like chess competitions or choir meetings.
                            </p>
                            <img src="./image.png">
                            <p>
                                Such environments promote stronger health outcomes, social interaction, skill acquisition and emotional development within children. Children can learn to exercise more often. Teenagers can learn to interact with people outside of their own environment and make connections. Maybe, just maybe, young people would not be as anxious and dejected as they are now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I could even reach further to say that an increase in outdoor activity for young people helps improve their academic performance. After all, nature is the gift that just keeps on giving.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are no guarantees of course, but according to <a href="https://www.unicef.org/eca/stories/importance-outdoor-play-and-how-support-it">UNICEF</a>, recreational activity does have a significant positive impact on the behaviour of children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, incorporating recreational areas into a community immediately increases the economic value of the area, helping to attract a variety of business to the area which could further support the needs of the residents. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It could encourage people of all ages to form running groups. It could lead to people hosting more communal gatherings for entertainment. It could promote fund-raising events such as hiking or clean-up campaigns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The improvement in quality of life for all people, young and old, becomes quite clear. For example, building outdoor multi-purpose courts surrounded by stationed benches, and paths traversing greenery and tall trees would be a compelling prospect for most residents aiming to live a healthy lifestyle.
                            </p>

                                Building something of that scale might be a bit out of reach for the local municipality. As has been the case with many building projects, costs can accumulate to quite high levels when serious considerations have to be made. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Such considerations include location, site preparation, surfacing, and equipment of a game court, which run-up to six figure amounts very quickly. This only accounts for the court itself. Any other amenities like fencing, seating and lighting would need more funding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In that case, the proposition would need to be simple.

                            <li>
                                Coloured acrylic paint markings and game installations for volleyball, basketball and tennis

                            <li>
                                Benches outside the court for seating.
                            </li>
                            <p>
                                Such a court could be feasible in the near future. An example of such a court in the country would be from <i>Malkerns Square</i>:
                            </p>
                            <img src="./malkerns.jpg">
                            <p>
                                From this example, the only thing lacking would be the equipment and marking necessary for people wanting to play volleyball. Public courts in the country, such as <i>Mbabane Coronation Park</i> hold multiple courts instead of one but present the same options for sports.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An injured child is a costly expense. Socio-economic differences between children from differing families can be a boost in improving the diversity and resilience of the community. However, it is a double-edged sword that can derail any child’s emotional development when bullying and ethnic exclusion rears their ugly heads.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For many recreational activities, money is involved in one way or another – be it the need for new gear, or food. Playing outdoors also means less time spent by the child with their school homework or chores.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the potential problems that come with recreational areas are valid, I have to say that I’d find it hard to believe that they out-weight the potential benefits.

                                Making an effort to bring more recreational areas to growing neighbourhoods is a step that should be taken country-wide. Not only does it promote the development of urban neighbourhoods for both the people and businesses, but it helps improve the lives of many children.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the youth of these neighbourhoods, such a step opens the door to a plethora of opportunities for personal growth and development. For everyone else, it’s an opportunity to build meaningful connections in our communities and enhance our collective physical and mental health.
